This is my first Repository in Git.
I have used the following commands to get to this point.
I installed the Git Client via Internet from the following link:
https://git-scm.com/download/win
After installing the software I launched it.
In the Command Prompt:
I set the configuration for
git --config user.name "tayyabehsan"
git --config user.email tayyabehsan@gmail.com

**To check the configuration
git --config list
**To check the current path
pwd

To check version and/or help with commands
git --version
git --help

***This will be your base folder for creating repositories
To make the directory
mkdir Git_Demo

To remove the directory
rm -Rf Git_Demo

To change the directory
cd Git_Demo/

***In the base folder create another folder
mkdir FirstRepo
cd FirstRepo/


**To Create Repository in the current folder
git init

**Now if you check the pwd there will be a (master) mark end of the path showing that this is the master branch. You can have multiple branches in a repository. When you navigte to a particular branch it will show that marker in the path.
